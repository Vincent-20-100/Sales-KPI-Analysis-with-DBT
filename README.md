Welcome to my first dbt project!


As part of my Data Analyst training, I created this comprehensive data transformation project using DBT, with a specific focus on analyzing sales KPIs using open-source data. This project serves as both a showcase of my technical skills and a foundational piece in my portfolio.


This DBT project includes:

Sales KPI Analysis: The project is centered around key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to sales, such as revenue, margin, average basket value, and transaction volume. By focusing on these metrics, the project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights for business decision-making.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The pipeline is built on carefully structured SQL queries, handling essential data cleaning and transformations needed to ensure accurate analysis of sales metrics.

Documentation: A complete schema.yml file includes all necessary tests (such as not_null and unique constraints) and provides clear descriptions for each model and field, ensuring transparency and clarity throughout the pipeline.

Automated Reporting: Leveraging DBT’s reporting features, the project generates automated reports, presenting sales KPIs and trends in a way that’s easy to interpret.
Organized Project Structure: The project is structured into logical folders (staging, intermediate, mart) that mirror the data flow from raw data to final KPIs. This organization helps users quickly understand the purpose and function of each component, making the pipeline highly accessible.

With a focus on analyzing sales KPIs through open-source data, this project showcases a professional, well-documented data pipeline that translates raw data into valuable insights.


Enjoy exploring!
