Welcome to my first dbt project!


As part of my Data Analyst training, I created this data transformation project using DBT. This project represents my first DBT/GitHub project, which I have thoroughly reviewed, expanded, and cleaned to make it a showcase for my portfolio on GitHub.

In addition to all the necessary SQL queries for data cleaning and transformation, I developed a complete schema.yml file to set up essential tests and detailed descriptions for a well-structured pipeline. Thanks to this setup, DBT can automatically generate reports, and the entire pipeline structure is clearly documented, making it easy for anyone to understand and use.

Enjoy exploring!
